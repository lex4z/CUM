2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on clear relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on enable relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on j relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on k relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on preset relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on jk_out relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch q_reg_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin q_reg_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 1 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
